Pseudocode

===========================================

Algorithm mangoLocation(ix, cx, id, cd)
requires: Ishraq's location, Clement's location, Ishraq's distance to the mango, and Clement's distance to the mango, respectively
returns: Mongo's location

eg. mangoLocation(ix, cx, id, cd)=mx
    mangoLocation(2, 6, 1, 3)=3
first from ix and id, we can work out 2 numbers;
then from cx and cd, we can work out another 2 numbers.

compare these 4, the common result will be the answer mx.

    var ix1 = ix-id;
    var ix2 = ix+id;
    var cx1 = cx-cd;
    var cx2 = cx+cd;

    if (ix1==cx1) return ix1;
    if (ix1==cx2) return ix1;
    if (ix2==cx1) return ix2;
    if (ix2==cx2) return ix2;
    return null;
