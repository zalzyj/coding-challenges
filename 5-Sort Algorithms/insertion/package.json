    "description": "Insertion sort\r     This is the simplest sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted list one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort. However, insertion sort has the features: 1. Simple implementation; 2. O(n2) same as selection sort or bubble sort;",
